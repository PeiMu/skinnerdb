SkinnerDB is a relational database management system for data analysis. It processes SQL queries adaptively, i.e. the query plan keeps changing during query execution. This helps SkinnerDB to deal with queries for which it is hard to decide a good join order in advance. <a class="twitter-share-button" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=SkinnerDB%20learns%20optimal%20join%20orders%20during%20query%20processing%20-%20check%20it%20out%21%20%40ImmanuelTrummer%20%23ML%20%23AI%20%23Databases%20%23SQL">

SkinnerDB uses reinforcement learning to decide which plans to try. It executes selected plans for few milliseconds and measures the speed of evaluation. Via those measurements, it learns to select better plans for the remaining query execution. Result fragments generated by different plans are finally combined into a complete query result.
